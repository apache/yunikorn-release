Reference:
 - [ASF Release Creation Process](https://infra.apache.org/release-publishing.html)
 - [ASF Release Policy](http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html).

# Release Procedure
A simplified procedure: 
- Create a release branch in all git repos, such as `branch-0.8`
- Stabilize the release
- Create a tag and prepare to generate the release, e.g `v0.8.0`
- Run the release tool to generate source code tarball, checksum and signature
- Upload tarball, signature and checksum as a release candidate
- Start a voting thread for the project 
- Publish the release (source code, helm chart and pre-build images)
- Update the website

The full procedure is documented in the [release procedure](https://yunikorn.apache.org/community/release_procedure).
