# Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) - A Universal Scheduler

Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) is a light-weight, universal resource scheduler for container orchestrator systems.
It was created to achieve fine-grained resource sharing for various workloads efficiently on a large scale, multi-tenant,
and cloud-native environment. YuniKorn brings a unified, cross-platform, scheduling experience for mixed workloads that consist
of stateless batch workloads and stateful services. 

YuniKorn now supports K8s and can be deployed as a custom K8s scheduler. YuniKorn's architecture design also allows adding different
shim layer and adopt to different ResourceManager implementation including Apache Hadoop YARN, or any other systems. 

## Feature highlights

### Main scheduling features:

- Features to support both batch jobs and long-running/stateful services
- Hierarchy queues with min/max resource quotas.
- Resource fairness between queues, users and apps.
- Cross-queue preemption based on fairness.
- Customized resource types (like GPU) scheduling support.
- Rich placement constraints support.
- Automatically map incoming container requests to queues by policies. 
- Node partition: partition cluster to sub-clusters with dedicated quota/ACL management.

### Integration with K8s:

The `k8shim` provides the integration for K8s scheduling and supported features include: 

- _Predicates:_ All kinds of predicates such as node-selector, pod affinity/anti-affinity, taint/tolerant, etc.
- _Persistent volumes:_ We have verified hostpath, EBS, NFS, etc. 
- _K8s namespace awareness:_ YuniKorn support hierarchical of queues, does it mean you need to give up K8s namespace? Answer is no, with simple config, YuniKorn is able to 
 support automatically map K8s namespaces to YuniKorn queues. All K8s-namespace-related ResourceQuota, permissions will be still valid.
- _Metrics:_ Prometheus, Grafana integration.
- _Cluster AutoScaler_: YuniKorn can nicely work with Cluster AutoScaler (https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) to drive cluster scales up and down.
- _K8s Events_: YuniKorn also integrated with K8s events, so lots of information can be retrieved by using `kubectl describe pod`.

#### Deployment model
Yunikorn can be deployed as a K8s custom scheduler, and take over all POD scheduling. 
An enhancement is open to improve coexistence behaviour of the YuniKorn scheduler with other Kubernetes schedulers,
like the default scheduler, in the cluster: [Co-existing with other K8s schedulers](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-16).
