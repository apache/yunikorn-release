# Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) - A Universal Scheduler

Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) is a light-weight, universal resource scheduler for container orchestrator systems.
It was created to achieve fine-grained resource sharing for various workloads efficiently on a large scale, multi-tenant,
and cloud-native environment. YuniKorn brings a unified, cross-platform, scheduling experience for mixed workloads that consist
of stateless batch workloads and stateful services. 

YuniKorn now supports K8s and can be deployed as a custom K8s scheduler. YuniKorn's architecture design also allows adding different
shim layer and adopt to different ResourceManager implementation including Apache Hadoop YARN, or any other systems. 

## Feature highlights

- Features to support both batch jobs and long-running/stateful services.
- Hierarchy queues with min/max resource quotas.
- Resource fairness between queues, users and apps.
- Cross-queue preemption based on fairness.
- Automatically map incoming container requests to queues by policies. 
- Node partition: partition cluster to sub-clusters with dedicated quota/ACL management.
- Fully compatible with K8s predicates, events, PV/PVC and admin commands.
- Supports to work with [Cluster AutoScaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) to drive cluster scales up and down. 

## Deployment model
YuniKorn can be deployed with [helm-charts](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/yunikorn/yunikorn) on an existing K8s cluster. It can be deployed with or without the admission controller. When the admission controller is enabled, YuniKorn will be the primary scheduler that takes over the resource scheduling (the admission controller runs a mutation webhook that automatically mutates pod spec's schedulerName to yunikorn); when it is disabled, user needs to manually change the schedulerName to `yunikorn` in order to get apps scheduled by YuniKorn.

## Supported K8s versions 

| K8s Version   | Support?  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 1.12.x (or earlier) | X |
| 1.13.x | √ |
| 1.14.x | √ |
