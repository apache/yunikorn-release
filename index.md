----

[Apache YuniKorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/) is a light-weight, universal resource scheduler for container orchestrator systems.
It was created to achieve fine-grained resource sharing for various workloads efficiently on a large scale, multi-tenant,
and cloud-native environment. YuniKorn brings a unified, cross-platform, scheduling experience for mixed workloads that consist
of stateless batch workloads and stateful services. 

YuniKorn now supports K8s and can be deployed as a custom K8s scheduler. YuniKorn's architecture design also allows adding different
shim layer and adopt to different ResourceManager implementation including Apache Hadoop YARN, or any other systems. 

## Feature highlights

- App-aware scheduling
- Hierarchy Resource Queues
- Job Ordering and Queuing
- Resource fairness
- Resource Reservation
- Throughput

Read the complete list of features from [here](https://yunikorn.apache.org/docs/get_started/core_features).

## Web UI

YuniKorn has builtin web UIs for queue hierarchies and apps. See below:
